--To get an executable, you need to have a static C library libsat.a in the
directory lib

--libsat.a should implement the functions defined in satapi.h, which is located
in the directory include

--To obtain libsat.a, please go to the directory primitives in the previous path

--You should also implement the function "get_free_literal" in main.c, which
is located in the directory src

--Once you have all ingredients, you can simply type make, which would
produce a binary executable called "sat"

--You can type "./sat -help" to see its usage
