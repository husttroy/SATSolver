--To get an executable, you need to have a static C library libsat.a in the
directory lib/

--libsat.a should implement the functions defined in sat_api.h, which is located
in the directory include/

--To obtain libsat.a, please go to the directory primitives on the previous path

--Once you obtain libsat.a and locate it under lib/, you can simply type make,
which would produce a binary executable called "sat"

--You can type "./sat --help" to see its usage
