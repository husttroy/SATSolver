--sat_api.h, located in the directory include/, defines the functions you need
to implement together with the structures you must use to represent variables,
literals and clauses

--sat_api.c, located in the directory src/, provides an incomplete
implementation for each function defined in sat_api.h

--You are free to add more C files to complete the implementation of functions
in sat_api.c (in this case do not forget to update given Makefile)

--Once you are done with the implementation you can obtain a static C library by
typing make, which would produce the desired library called "libsat.a"

--You can then copy libsat.a into the directory ../sat_solver/lib/ to produce a
a sat solver, and the directory ../c2D_code/lib/ to produce a knowledge
compiler and a model counter
