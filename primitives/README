--satapi.h, located in the directory include, defines the functions you need to
implement together with the structures you must use to represent variables,
literals and clauses

--satapi.c, located in the directory src, gives a detailed explanation for each
function you will implement

--You are free to add more C files to complete the implementation of functions
in satapi.c (in this case do not forget to update given Makefile)

--Once you are done with the implementation you can obtain a static C library
by typing make, which would give the desired library called "libsat.a"

--You can then copy libsat.a into the directory ../sat_solver/lib so that you
can produce a sat solver
