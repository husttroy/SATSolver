# SATSolver

--The directory primitives defines the SAT primitives you need to
implement. All your work should be done in this directory, and you
will only submit this directory

--The directory sat_solver includes C code to build a SAT solver. When you
finish implementing the SAT primitives, you can immediately build a SAT solver
by linking the static C library libsat.a with the code in this directory (you
will create libsat.a in the directory primitives). Then you can test your
functions on the resulting SAT solver.

--The directory knowledge_compiler is not complete yet. We will provide more
details later.
